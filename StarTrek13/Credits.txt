I'd personally like to thank:

Asha_lapoe
Flaksim

For their work on a byond based trek game, whose assets Flaksim kindly gave us permission to use.

All the "perspective" walls and scenes (unless otherwise stated) were created by those two and subsequently modified by myself (Kmc2000) to fit the game.


Many thanks!
