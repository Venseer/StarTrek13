	-:k Lets you talk over the radio\n\
	-LOOC allows you to communicate out of character, but locally instead of globally\n\
	-You can undock a shuttle craft by ctrl / alt clicking it\n\
	-Roleplay rules are in effect! We're medium roleplay\n\
	-Setting up power means going into maint, look for the green and red deuterium and anti deuterium tanks, then use a wrench and set the flow rate to 5\n\
	-Ship not able to warp? Did you enable the warp plasma injectors in the warp nacelle near the tanks?\n\
	-If you can't open the plasma relay UI, click it with an open hand instead!\n\
	-Click on the small button on the turbolifts to use them\n\
	-Alt click the comms console to privately hail people\n\
	-Tools are given an random name and sprite, engineers can find which is which using examine, however within the round, all 'grey crecent shaped discombobulators' will be the same tool\n\
	-Did you know you can build ships? Head to DS9 / Barnard's star (gamemode dependant) and use the purple console\n\
	-End up on the wrong ship? You were probably autobalanced\n\
	-Are you wearing the wrong uniform? This is a common problem, please ask an admin for a new set of clothes.\n\
	-To capture a system outpost, look for the blue console and click it with an empty hand\n\
	-Restart votes are enabled if rounds go on for too long\n\
	If you are stuck in a view, check for a leave camera button in the upper left of your screen, if that doesn't work, use Cancel-Camera-View in the command bar\n\
	Most engineering interactions require either the wrench or screwdriver\n\
	-Ships and crews automatically respawn, but this comes with a penalty towards win conditions.</span>")
